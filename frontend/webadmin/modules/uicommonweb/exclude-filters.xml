     Ignore all the questionable casts from Collection to abstract collection in this module.
     Unfortunately, these warnings are currently inherit to the design, ListModel base items are
     of a type Collection and many times need to be cast to a List for sorting purposes etc.
     Handling those on an individual basis just adds noise to the process.
