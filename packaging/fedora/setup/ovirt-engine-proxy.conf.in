# Redirect all requests to the application server using the AJP
# protocol.
#
# The following parameters are recommended:
#
# retry=5
#
# This is needed to make sure that connections to the application server
# are recovered in a short time interval (5 seconds at the moment)
# otherwise when the application server is restarted the web server will
# refuse to connect during 60 seconds.
#
# timeout=600
#
# This is needed to make sure that long RESTAPI requests have time to
# finish before the web server aborts the request as the default timeout
# (controlled by the Timeout directive in httpd.conf) is 60 seconds.
