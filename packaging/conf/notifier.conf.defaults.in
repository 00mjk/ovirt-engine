#
# This file holds the configuration of oVirt events notification daemon.
# The daemon consists of two major services: notification service and engine monitoring.
#

#-------------------------------------#
# Notification Service Configuration: #
#-------------------------------------#
# Interval (in seconds) between iterations of dispatching messages to subscribers. Default is 120 seconds.
INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS=120

# The SMTP mail server address. Required.
MAIL_SERVER=

# The SMTP port
MAIL_PORT=25
MAIL_PORT_SSL=465

# Required if SSL enabled to authenticate the user. Used also to specify 'from' user address if mail server
# supports, when MAIL_FROM is not set. Address is in RFC822 format
MAIL_USER=

# Required to authenticate the user if mail server requires authentication or if SSL is enabled
MAIL_PASSWORD=

# Indicates whether SSL should be used to communicate with mail server.
MAIL_ENABLE_SSL=false

# If set to true, sends a message in HTML format.
HTML_MESSAGE_FORMAT=false

# Specifies 'from' address on sent mail in RFC822 format, if supported by mail server.
MAIL_FROM=

# Specifies 'reply-to' address on sent mail in RFC822 format.
MAIL_REPLY_TO=

# Amount of days to keep dispatched events on history table. If 0, events remain on history table.
DAYS_TO_KEEP_HISTORY=0

# This parameter specifies how many days of old events are processed and sent
# when the notifier starts. If set to 2, for example, the notifier will
# process and send the events of the last two days, older events will just
# be marked as processed and won't be sent. The default is 0, so no old
# messages will be sent at all during startup.
DAYS_TO_SEND_ON_STARTUP=0

#----------------------------------#
# Engine Monitoring Configuration: #
#----------------------------------#
# Interval (in seconds) between engine server monitoring iterations. Interval is being measured from
# the time an iteration is completed.
ENGINE_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS=300

# Number of retries to monitor server status per iteration.
ENGINE_MONITOR_RETRIES=3

# Time (in seconds) to wait between retries.
ENGINE_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS=30

# If running Jboss in secure mode, should be set to true.
IS_HTTPS_PROTOCOL=false

# Specifies the protocol used by Jboss Configuration Connector when SSL is enabled.
SSL_PROTOCOL=TLS

# If running Jboss in secure mode, and wishes to ignore SSL errors, should set to true.
SSL_IGNORE_CERTIFICATE_ERRORS=false

# If running Jboss in secure mode, and wishes to ignore hostname verification, should set to true. Default is false.
# If setting this property to 'true', SSL_IGNORE_CERTIFICATE_ERRORS considered to be set to 'true' as well: disabling host name
# verification means that it will not be verified against the certification, therefore certification errors are ignored.
SSL_IGNORE_HOST_VERIFICATION=false

# Specifies whether to repeat auditing of failure messages of non-responding engine server. false means
# repeated failure messages will NOT be sent to the subscribers.
REPEAT_NON_RESPONSIVE_NOTIFICATION=false

# Location of engine pid
ENGINE_PID=@ENGINE_VAR@/ovirt-engine.pid
