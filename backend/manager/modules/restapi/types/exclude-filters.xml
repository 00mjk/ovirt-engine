        findbugs complains that we don't use break in map(),
        In this case we do want to "fall" to the next case because PowerSave case
        need to call setHight() and setDuration() as well.

        findbugs reason:
        SF: Switch statement found where one case falls through to the next case (SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH)
